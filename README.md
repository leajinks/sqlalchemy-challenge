# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this repository, I analyzed Hawaii weather data in a sqlite DB to visualize temperature and precipitation data across different weather stations. 
The climate_analysis.ipynb uses Python, SQLAlchemy, and Matplotlib to perform these tasks.

Based on the queries developed in the climate analysis, I designed a Flask API that utilizes static routes to view weather data from
the sqlite DB, and dynamic routes to view average temperature data in date ranges of the user's specifications.
